	Eye health is crucial for a human's well-being. It's important to keep our eyes and vision healthy by taking care of them. Having a good vision is important as we need to use our eyes in our daily life, wherever we go, or whoever we interact with. Our eye health must be taken care of seriously, before it leads to huge problems.
	Sometimes, we forget to take care of our eyes and keep doing our daily routines. Some adults work in offices, where they have to look at their device screens such as laptop, or desktops. Some students use computers to attend online classes. 
	When doing so, most of us don't take breaks, or rest our eyes. It could worsen our eye health.

	Having healthy eyes makes you be able to fight with eye diseases, and you will not get eye health issues easily. Some medicines for good eye health are: Lutein and zeaxanthin,
	Omega-3 fatty acids,
	Vitamins C and E, and
	Zinc.
	You may not know, but your eyes are truly critical in your life. It's better to start taking care of your eyes now, before it's too late.

Try closing your eyes. What will you see? <b>Darkness</b>.

Apparently, 2.2 billion people of the world's population struggle with this challenge. Such farsightedness or nearsightedness and other vision impairments are quite common, which shouldn't be.
