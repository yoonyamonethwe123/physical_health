   Taking care of your eyes is really important. Not only it plays an important role in our human beings, but also it is a very useful sensory organ. Those who were born with perfect vision and healthy eyes should be grateful and appreciative, as not everyone gets lucky. Millions of people were born with vision loss, which is quite terrible. Several organizations have taken action for this as well. If you have healthy eyes, why not keep on keeping it healthy and not ruin it?
</ul>

        <b>Here are some ways you can look after your eyes.</b>
        
            <li>
                Wear protective eyewear to protect your eyes from harmful UV rays or injuries.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use eye droplets to prevent your eyes from becoming dry.
            </li>
            <li>
                Have regular medical eye checkups at a great eye clinic, normally once every 6 months. (not that often if you do not have large eye health issues)
            </li>
            <li>
                Maintain a healthy balanced diet by eating foods like carrots, spinach, and fish to promote eye health. It will make your body resistance stronger, and reduce eye sight problems.
            </li>
            <li>
                Always rest your eyes after staring at a device screen, or doing something. Look at green things which can reduce eye strain and stress levels, go outside and take some fresh air.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drink plenty of water. It maintans eye moisture, gets rid of bacteria or small dust particles in your eyes, and improves your vision by keeping the eye <a href="https://biologydictionary.net/tissue/" style="font-family: HoloLens MDL2 Assets; color: rgb(8, 59, 8); font-size: 20px;">tissues</a> clear.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you have refractive errors such as farsightedness, you can take laser eye surgery (LASIK)
            </li>
